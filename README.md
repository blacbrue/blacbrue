### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is BlacBrue and I am a dedicated student who loves to program in my free time. I am currently working towards becoming a skilled developer and am focused on building my experience and portfolio through projects on GitHub. By showcasing my skills and projects on this platform, I hope to increase my chances of securing rewarding tech job opportunities in the future.

If you enjoy my work and would like to support me, I would be incredibly grateful if you could consider buying me a coffee on Ko-fi. Any donations received would be used to support my future education and personal growth. Thank you for considering!
